# IA-Planification

This project aims to plan the vsiualization of audovisual content in the Redflix platform. We have developed the planner and corresponding functionalities using [PDDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language).


## Structure

The repository contains all the source code in its root directory (the `.pddl` files). It also contains the outputs generated by each extension's implemented problem in the *./outputs/* directory.


## Execution

In order to execute the implemented experiments, use the *./MFF/ff* executable. Pass the domain definition as the `-o` argument and the experiment path as the `-f` argument. We also recommend using the search configuration `-s 1`. For instance, if we want to execute the Extension 3, we can run the following commands:

```bash
cd ./MFF
./ff -o ../Domain-Ext3.pddl -f ../Experiment-Ext3.pddl -s 1
```

And the output will appear on the console.
